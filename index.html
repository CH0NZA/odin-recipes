		<p>This is a list of my favorite dishes my mom makes. Each food links to her recipes and I hope all who see this enjoy.</p>

		<p>Pupusas are a popular Salvadoran dish. My <a href="./pages/pupusas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mom's recipe</a> is amazing because she makes the ingredients from scratch and cooks the dough more than most restaurants.</p>

		<!-- Enchiladas -->
		<h2>Enchiladas</h2>

		<p>My <a href="./recipes/enchiladas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mom's recipe</a> is a little different from other recipes because she layers the tortillas lasagna-style rather than rolling them.</p>
